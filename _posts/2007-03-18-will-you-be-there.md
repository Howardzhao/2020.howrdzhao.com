Michael Jackson －Will You Be There   
   
Hold me , Like the River Jordan   
And I will then say to thee  , You are my friend   
   
Carry me Like you are my brother   
Love me like a mother ,  Will you be there   
   
Weary   
Tell me ,  will you hold me   
When wrong will you scold me   
When losTwill you find me   
   
BuTthey told me   
A man should be faithfull   
And walk when noTable   
And fighT'til the end   
BuTI'm only human   
   
Everyone's taking control of me   
Seems thaTthe world's   
GoTa role for me   
I'm so confused   
Will you show to me   
You'll be there for me   
And care enough to bear me   
   
…………   
   
<span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;"> Spoken:</span>   
In our darkesThour   
In my deepesTdespair   
Will you still care   
Will you be there   
In my trials   
And my tribulations   
   
Through our doubts   
And frustrations   
In my violence   
In my turbulence   
Through my fear   
And my confessions   
In my anguish and my pain   
Through my joy and my sorrow   
   
In the promise Of another tomorrow   
I'll never leTyou parT  
For you're always in my hearT
