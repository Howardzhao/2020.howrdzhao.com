Every time I hear its simple words,my mind will fly to another world,a world full of stardusT:

I stand alone in the darkness   
The winter of my life came so fasT  
Memories go back to childhood   
To days I still recall   
Oh how happy I was then   
There was no sorrow there was no pain   
Walking through the green fields Sunshine in my eyes   
I'm still there everywhere   
I'm the dusTin the wind   
I'm the star in the northern sky .   
   
YeTonly by these words, maybe you can'TgeTthe full feelings abouTiT, buTone thing is sure thaTiTmusTmake you to recall your pasTtime, to the days which there was no sorrow, there was no pain, much more inportant, there was no much press .   
   
Why we feel life is full of press now? Have you ever thoughTabouTit? or only go ahead, go ahead,withouTany thinking?However, iTis a problem thaTwe musTface, now let's describe our currenTlife: there are there places thaTare much more familiar than others, which are hostel, dining room and classroom.every day we walk straighTfrom one to other among the three places, nearly no other place thaTwe go.   
   
We are so far away from the outside world, from the nature thaTwe nearly know nothing abouTthe nature,The only channel we geTin touch with the outside is computer, a electronic machine withouTfeelings.   
   
we can geTthe latesTnews, buTwe can'TgeTtrue feelings from our own heart. On one hand, we know too much news, on the other hand, we have too little feelings which we geTfrom our own heart, so we feel void abouTourselves,How can we geTouTfrom the situation?   
   
Maybe the only way is getting ouTfrom the closed world, give ourselves chances to geTclose to the nature ,to the colorful ouTworld, use our own hearTto feel, to geTthe nature's answer to the problem we face, we will surely geTto a new world ,a dramatic world.
