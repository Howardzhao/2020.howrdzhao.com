hey lady,you lady   
cursin' aTyour life   
you're a discontened mother   
and a regimented wife   
i've no doubTyou dream abouT  
the thinds you'll never do   
buTi wish someone had to talked to me   
like i wanna talk to you   
i've been to georgia and california   
and anywhere i could run   
took the head of a preacher man   
and we made love in the sun   
buTi ran ouTof places and friendly faces   
because i had to be free   
i've been to paradise   
buTi've never been to me   
please lady,please lady   
don'TjusTwalk away   
'cause i have this need to tell you   
why i'm alone today   
ican see so much of me   
still living in your eyes   
won'Tyou share a parTof a weary hearT  
thaThas lived million lies   
oh i've been to nice and the isle of greece   
while i sipped champagne on a yachT  
i moved like harloTin monte carlo   
and showed'em whaTi've goT  
i've been undressed by kings   
and i've seen some things   
thaTa woman ain'Tsupposed to see,   
hey lady i've been to paradise   
buTi 've never been to me   
   
sometimes i've been to cryin'   
for unborn children   
thaTmighThave made me complete   
buTi,i took the sweeTlife   
and never knew   
i'd bitter from the sweeT  
i spenTmy life exploring the subtle whoring   
thaTcosTtoo much to be free hey lady,   
i've been to paradise (i've been to paradise)   
i've been to paradise   
buTi've never been to me
